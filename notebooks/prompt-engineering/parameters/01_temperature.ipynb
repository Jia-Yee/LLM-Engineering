    "## Introduction\n",
    "Temperature is a crucial parameter in Large Language Models that controls the randomness and creativity of the model's outputs. It is typically set between 0 and 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature = 0**: The model becomes deterministic, always choosing the most likely next token\n",
    "- **Temperature = 1**: The model maintains the original probability distribution\n",
    "- **Temperature > 1**: The model increases randomness, making all token probabilities more uniform\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of temperature as a \"creativity knob\" - lower values make the model more focused and consistent, while higher values make it more creative and diverse."
