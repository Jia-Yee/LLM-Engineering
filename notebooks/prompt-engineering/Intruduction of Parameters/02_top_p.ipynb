    "# Top-p (Nucleus Sampling) Parameter in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Top-p, also known as nucleus sampling, is a text generation parameter that helps control the randomness of the model's output by considering only the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the specified top-p value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-p = 0.1**: Very focused, considers only the most probable tokens\n",
    "- **Top-p = 0.5**: Balanced, considers moderately probable tokens\n",
    "- **Top-p = 1.0**: Considers all possible tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike temperature, which scales probabilities, top-p truncates the probability distribution to only include the most likely tokens up to the cumulative probability threshold."

The ball could grant the user the ability to witness historical events firsthand, meet famous figures from history, or even change the course of events in the past.\n",
      "3. Mind Reading: A magical crystal ball could also have the power to read minds, allowing the user to gain insight into the thoughts and intentions of others. The ball could reveal the deepest desires and fears of those around them, granting the user an unfair advantage in social situations or even allowing them to manipulate the thoughts and actions of others.\n",

The ball might show images or visions that reveal information about upcoming events, potential outcomes, or the thoughts and intentions of others.\n",
      "2. Communication with spirits: In some magical systems, the crystal ball could be used as a means of communication with spirits or other supernatural entities. The user might be able to summon the spirits of ancestors, nature deities, or other beings to receive guidance or advice through the crystal ball.\n",
      "3. Time travel: Depending on the magical properties of the crystal ball, it could potentially be used for time travel. The user might be able to gaze into the ball and see glimpses of the past or future, or even interact with people or events from different time periods. However, this would likely require a great deal of magic and knowledge to execute successfully.\n",

      "2. Time Travel: The crystal ball could potentially be used as a portal to other times and places. By focusing one's thoughts on a specific time or location and gazing into the ball, a person could find themselves transported to that time and place. This could be useful for both personal exploration and historical research.\n",
      "3. Mind Reading: The crystal ball could also be used as a tool for telepathy, allowing the user to read the thoughts of others. By concentrating on a particular person's mind and gazing into the ball, the user could gain insight into their deepest desires, fears, and motivations. This could be useful in a variety of situations, from business negotiations to personal relationships.\n"
