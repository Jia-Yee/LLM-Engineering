    "The system prompt is a special instruction set that defines the model's behavior, personality, and operational constraints. It acts as a foundation for how the model should interpret and respond to subsequent user prompts.\n",

    "Key aspects:\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Affects all following interactions\n",
    "- **Scope**: Can define roles, constraints, and behaviors\n",
    "- **Priority**: Usually takes precedence over user prompts\n",
    "- **Format**: Natural language instructions\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Role Definition**\n",

    "- Keep system prompts clear and concise\n",
    "- Test with various user inputs\n",
    "- Layer instructions logically\n",
    "- Include error handling guidance\n",
    "- Document system prompts\n",
    "- Regular validation and updates"
