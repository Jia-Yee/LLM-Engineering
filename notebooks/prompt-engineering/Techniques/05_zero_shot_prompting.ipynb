    "# Zero-Shot Prompting in Recruiting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting is a technique where we ask an LLM to perform a task without providing any examples in the prompt. Unlike few-shot prompting, which includes examples to guide the model's behavior, zero-shot prompting relies on clear instructions and the model's pre-trained knowledge to generate appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **No Examples Required**: The model performs tasks based solely on instructions\n",
    "2. **Clear Task Description**: Detailed instructions are crucial for success\n",
    "3. **Leveraging Pre-trained Knowledge**: Utilizing the model's existing understanding\n",
    "4. **Structured Output Format**: Specifying desired response format\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Quickly adapt to different recruiting tasks without example preparation\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Shorter prompts, faster implementation\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to apply across various recruiting scenarios\n"
