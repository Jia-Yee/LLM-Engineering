    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting is an advanced technique that systematically explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree-like structure, evaluating different possibilities at each decision point. In recruiting, this approach is particularly valuable for complex candidate evaluations and job matching decisions where multiple factors need to be considered simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Branching Decisions**: Breaking down complex decisions into multiple paths\n",
    "2. **Systematic Exploration**: Evaluating different possibilities at each node\n",
    "3. **Path Evaluation**: Assessing the strength of different reasoning branches\n",
    "4. **Decision Tree Structure**: Organizing thoughts in a hierarchical manner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Explores multiple decision paths systematically\n",
    "- **Better Decision Making**: Evaluates different possibilities before final decision\n",
    "- **Structured Approach**: Organizes complex evaluations clearly\n",
    "- **Transparent Process**: Clear documentation of decision paths\n",
    "- **Reduced Oversight**: Less likely to miss important factors"
