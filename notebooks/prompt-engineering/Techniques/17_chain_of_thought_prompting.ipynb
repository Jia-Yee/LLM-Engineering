    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. In recruiting, this approach is particularly valuable for making well-reasoned decisions about candidates and job fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Breaking down complex decisions into logical steps\n",
    "2. **Explicit Thought Process**: Showing the reasoning behind each conclusion\n",
    "3. **Structured Analysis**: Organizing thoughts in a clear, sequential manner\n",
    "4. **Transparent Decision-Making**: Making the evaluation process clear and traceable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **Better Decision Quality**: More thorough evaluation through structured thinking\n",
    "- **Reduced Bias**: Explicit reasoning helps identify and minimize biases\n",
    "- **Consistent Evaluation**: Standardized approach across different candidates\n",
    "- **Defendable Decisions**: Clear reasoning chain for hiring choices\n",
    "- **Training Tool**: Helps junior recruiters learn evaluation processes"
