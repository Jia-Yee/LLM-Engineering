    "1. **Task Description**\n",
    "   - Clear statement of what you want the model to do\n",
    "   - Specific instructions about the desired output format\n",
    "   - Example: \"Analyze this resume and extract key skills\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context**\n",
    "   - Background information needed for the task\n",
    "   - Relevant constraints or requirements\n",
    "   - Example: \"You are an experienced technical recruiter reviewing candidates for a senior software engineer position\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Data**\n",
    "   - The specific content to be processed\n",
    "   - Can be text, structured data, or examples\n",
    "   - Example: A job description or resume text\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Format**\n",
    "   - Desired structure of the response\n",
    "   - Can be JSON, bullet points, paragraphs, etc.\n",
    "   - Example: \"Return the analysis in JSON format with skills, experience, and education sections\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples (Few-shot Learning)**\n",
    "   - Sample inputs and desired outputs\n",
    "   - Helps model understand the expected format\n",
    "   - Example: Showing a sample resume analysis before processing a new one\n",

    "6. **Constraints and Guidelines**\n",
    "   - Specific limitations or requirements\n",
    "   - Style preferences or tone\n",
    "   - Example: \"Keep the response concise and professional\"\n",
