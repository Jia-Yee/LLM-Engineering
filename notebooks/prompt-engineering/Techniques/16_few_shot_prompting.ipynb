    "# Few-Shot Prompting in Recruiting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where we provide the model with a few examples of the desired input-output behavior before asking it to perform a similar task. This approach helps guide the model's responses by demonstrating the expected pattern and format through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Example-Based Learning**: Providing sample input-output pairs\n",
    "2. **Pattern Recognition**: Model learns from demonstrated patterns\n",
    "3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintaining uniform structure across examples\n",
    "4. **Context Setting**: Examples establish task context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: Examples guide more precise responses\n",
    "- **Consistent Output**: Better format adherence\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Examples teach domain-specific terminology\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Examples set quality standards"
