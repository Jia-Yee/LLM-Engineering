       "1. **Python**: The candidate has extensive Python experience, which is a must-have for the job requirement.\n",
       "2. **TensorFlow vs. PyTorch**: While TensorFlow was specifically mentioned in the job requirement, having experience with PyTorch is not necessarily a deal-breaker. Both are popular deep learning frameworks, and skills can be transferable between them. In fact, many machine learning engineers have experience with both.\n",
       "3. **AWS vs. GCP**: Here's where things get interesting. The candidate has expertise in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), while the job requirement asks for Amazon Web Services (AWS) experience. However, knowledge of cloud computing platforms is transferable to some extent. A candidate with GCP experience can still learn AWS and adapt to its ecosystem.\n",
