    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use Prompting is an advanced technique that enables LLMs to perform calculations, logical operations, and use tools as part of their reasoning process. In recruiting, this approach is particularly valuable for analyzing candidate qualifications, calculating experience, and matching job requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Computational Reasoning**: Performing calculations within the prompt\n",
    "2. **Logical Analysis**: Breaking down complex requirements into measurable criteria\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: Using built-in capabilities for data processing\n",
    "4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying and extracting relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **Accurate Experience Calculation**: Precise computation of years of experience\n",
    "- **Systematic Matching**: Structured comparison of qualifications\n",
    "- **Objective Assessment**: Data-driven evaluation process\n",
    "- **Efficient Screening**: Automated initial candidate assessment\n",
    "- **Consistent Evaluation**: Standardized calculation methods"
