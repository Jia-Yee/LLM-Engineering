    "# Frequency Penalty Parameter in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The frequency_penalty parameter helps control the diversity of the model's output by penalizing tokens based on their frequency in the generated text. Unlike presence_penalty which penalizes tokens that appear at all, frequency_penalty scales its penalty based on how often tokens have been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects:\n",
    "- **Range**: Usually -2.0 to 2.0\n",
    "- **Positive values**: Decrease likelihood of frequent tokens\n",
    "- **Negative values**: Increase likelihood of frequent tokens\n",
    "- **Zero**: No frequency-based adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding frequency_penalty is crucial for:\n",
    "- Controlling vocabulary diversity\n",
    "- Managing writing style consistency\n",
    "- Balancing repetition and variation"

    "Choose frequency_penalty based on your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Penalty (0.7 to 2.0)**\n",
    "   - Creative writing\n",
    "   - Diverse vocabulary needs\n",
    "   - Exploratory content\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medium Penalty (0.3 to 0.7)**\n",
    "   - General writing\n",
    "   - Balanced vocabulary\n",
    "   - Most conversational tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Low or Negative Penalty (-2.0 to 0.3)**\n",
    "   - Technical writing\n",
    "   - Consistent terminology\n",
    "   - Educational content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Start with frequency_penalty = 0.0 and adjust based on needs\n",
    "- Higher values increase vocabulary diversity but may reduce precision\n",
    "- Lower values maintain consistent terminology but might feel repetitive\n",
    "- Can be used with presence_penalty for fine-tuned control\n",
    "- Consider the domain-specific needs (technical vs creative)\n",
    "- Monitor coherence when using extreme values"
