    "## Introduction\n",
    "Self Consistency Prompting is an advanced technique that generates multiple reasoning paths for the same problem and aggregates their results to arrive at a more reliable conclusion. In recruiting, this approach is particularly valuable for complex candidate evaluations and job matching scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Multiple Reasoning Paths**: Generating different approaches to analyze the same information\n",
    "2. **Consensus Building**: Finding agreement among different analyses\n",
    "3. **Reliability Enhancement**: Improving decision confidence through multiple perspectives\n",
    "4. **Bias Reduction**: Minimizing individual reasoning path biases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages in Recruiting\n",
    "- **More Reliable Evaluations**: Multiple analyses reduce chance of oversight\n",
    "- **Reduced Bias**: Different perspectives balance out individual biases\n",
    "- **Increased Confidence**: Consensus among multiple paths validates decisions\n",
    "- **Better Decision Making**: Comprehensive view of candidate-job fit\n",
    "- **Systematic Approach**: Structured method for complex evaluations"
