    "## Introduction\n",
    "Stop sequences are specific strings that tell the model when to stop generating text. They act as termination signals, allowing fine-grained control over where the model's output should end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects:\n",
    "- **Format**: Can be single characters, words, or phrases\n",
    "- **Multiple stops**: Can specify multiple stop sequences\n",
    "- **Case sensitivity**: Usually case-sensitive\n",
    "- **Whitespace**: Handling depends on implementation\n",

    "- Controlling output boundaries\n",
    "- Maintaining format consistency\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Output**\n",
    "   - Use delimiters like `###` or `===`\n",
    "   - Consider using unique tokens\n",
    "   - Match start/end patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversational**\n",
    "   - Use turn indicators (`User:`, `Assistant:`)\n",
    "   - Consider newlines as stops\n",
    "   - Use clear dialogue markers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **List Generation**\n",
    "   - Use numbering patterns\n",
    "   - Consider item separators\n",
    "   - Use consistent formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Keep stop sequences unique and unambiguous\n",
    "- Test stop sequences with sample outputs\n",
    "- Consider case sensitivity\n",
    "- Use multiple stop sequences when needed\n",
    "- Be careful with common words as stops\n",
